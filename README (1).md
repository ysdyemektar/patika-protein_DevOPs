Hello,
I added the projects I made with the information I learned in this bootcamp.

1 week

I wrote backup and alerting scripts. Backing up users' home directory and archiving at 23:05, warning e-mail if CPU usage is above 90%.

2 weeks

The developer should be able to compile only a specific branch, warning if it is in a different branch, and switch there if the branch he wants to build is not, includes their script.


3 weeks

The user wants to run the application in the app directory with docker.
The user should be able to give the image name and image tag for the image built for the application. This must be a mandatory parameter, if the user does not specify one of these two parameters, the script should give ERROR and terminate.
The user should be able to run this docker image locally, define memory and cpu limits while running the image. By default, no limit should be specified unless a limit is specified, that is, it should work without limit.
Two image registers should be presented to the user, dockerhub and gitlab image registery, the user should be able to push the image to the desired registery.
